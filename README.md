# Flight Simulator  Flight Plans

A few flight simulator flight plans as I fly around.

# List of Flight Plans:

[Flight Plans](plans/README.md)

# Flight Sim environment:

* [X-Plane-12](https://www.x-plane.com/)
* [MSFS-2020](https://www.flightsimulator.com/)
* [Pilot3ATC](https://pilot2atc.com/) - This is usually my goto for flight sim planning.

> **Warning**
X-Plane requires you to copy the flight plans to:
{x-plane-root-folder}/Output/FMS plans
* For example, on Windows:
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\X-Plane 12\Output\FMS plans
* On Linux, this may be:
~/X-Plane 12/Output/FMS plans
The folder "FMS plans" Usually does'nt exist by default and may need to be
created.
